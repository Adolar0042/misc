# Misc - a mashup of random files

## [No Doxxing](https://github.com/Adolar0042/misc/no-doxxing.txt)

A filter list intended for use in uBlock Origin that contains a few common items that show either location or ip that I come across
Feel free to contribute stuff you find to it.

I also recommend adding the following filter lists to uBlock in order to block common ip-grabbers:

- [Grabify Domains](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/M-rcus/9af3207273bf5d30b28c2e3892f1a412/raw/fa69c2cec0a58c0b5d10f7addf5ec90c962b5eff/Grabify_Domains.txt)
- [General ip loggers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piperun/iploggerfilter/master/filterlist)
> **Warning**
> I do not gurantee that the filter list will block all elements that might dox you (since I am only one person, using only so many services), so please still apply common sense when browsing the web on stream or smth!
